		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		
		<p>
		There are all sorts of movie monsters, and here, you will have a choice between a variety of categories.
		You can choose one category, or all of them.
		
		<br>
		You will be given five questions, each of varying difficulty. Question one is worth one point, question two is worth
		two, and so on, with the final question being worth five points. So there are 15 points up for grabs.
